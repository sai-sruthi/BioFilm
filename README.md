# BioFilm
Cellular Automata Representation of Bio Film

### Bio Film

Biofilms are communities of very small organisms that adhere to a substratum(surface) because their chances of survival improve when they reside in colonies. 
In this project, we have tried to simulate simple biofilms reflecting their formation and sustenance.
Each bacterium has a growth rate with which they divide and a nutrient consumption rate as well.

### Cellular Automata
The simulation of growth of a biofilm involves a cellular automation of two 
m x n grids, one representing the nutrients and the other representing the bacteria. 
Bacteria Grid:The state of a bacterium in a cell depends on the state of its four neighbours. 
Nutrient Grid: For diffusion of a nutrient throughout the grid, we consider the nutrient value in eight neighboring cells.
